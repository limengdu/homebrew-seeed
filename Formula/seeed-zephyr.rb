# Homebrew formula for the seeed-zephyr CLI.
#
# The CLI is a pure-Python package published to PyPI as a universal wheel, so
# this formula installs that wheel directly into an isolated virtualenv.
#
# On each CLI release, update `url` and `sha256` to the new wheel listed at:
#   https://pypi.org/pypi/seeed-zephyr/<version>/json
#
# Users install via:
#   brew tap limengdu/seeed
#   brew install limengdu/seeed/seeed-zephyr
